## Netlify Enquiry Form: Local & Production Testing

This project uses a production-grade Netlify form for the /enquiry page, with AJAX, spam protection, and static fallback.

### Local Development

1. Install the Netlify CLI if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```
2. Start the local Netlify dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev:netlify
   ```
   This will emulate Netlify's form handling and environment variables locally.

3. Ensure you have the following in your `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key
   VITE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```
   (Get these from your Google reCAPTCHA v2 admin panel.)

### Testing the Form
- All fields are required. The form will block submission if any are empty or invalid.
- The form uses AJAX to submit to Netlify. On success, you'll see a thank you message. On error, your draft is saved and restored.
- The honeypot field and reCAPTCHA v2 protect against spam.
- If JavaScript is disabled, the form will POST to `/thank-you.html` (static fallback).

### Netlify Dashboard Setup
- In your Netlify site dashboard, go to Site > Forms > Settings and enable reCAPTCHA v2.
- You can view form submissions and spam in the Netlify dashboard.

### Static Fallback
- `public/thank-you.html` and `public/error.html` provide fallback for non-JS browsers.
- The `_redirects` file ensures `/error` redirects to `/enquiry` and all other routes fallback to the SPA.

### Acceptance Tests
- The form blocks submission if required fields are empty.
- Submits successfully and hits Netlify (mock 200) when all fields + reCAPTCHA are valid.
- Caches form data on network failure and repopulates on refresh.
- Honeypot filled â‡’ JavaScript still fires but Netlify marks as spam.
