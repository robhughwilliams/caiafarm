      content: `Our story begins in the early-Victorian countryside.
The 1842 tithe survey shows Caeau Farm (Meaning The Fields in Welsh) as a compact small holding surrounded by pasture plots numbered 49â€“56. A cart-track linked the yard to the old Wrexham road, while a small pond (plot 51) waters stock in the meadow below. The farm was run by a small tenant-farmer family with a mix between arable and livestock, the classic Welsh "mixed farm" of its day. The occupier at the time was John Norbury and the landowner was the Dean and Chapter of Winchester.`

      content: `Three decades later the first large-scale OS map captures the farm in full Victorian stride. New buildings flank the original farmhouse, while neat lines of trees mark the boundaries. The map labels the holding "Caeau", affirming both its Welsh roots. Produce at this time would have travelled to town markets by horse-drawn cart.`
