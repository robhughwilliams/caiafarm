      content: `Our story begins in the early-Victorian countryside.
The 1842 tithe survey shows Caeau Farm (Meaning The Fields in Welsh) as a compact small holding surrounded by pasture plots numbered 49â€“56. A cart-track linked the yard to the old Wrexham road, while a small pond (plot 51) still exists today. The farm was run by a small tenant-farmer family with a mix between arable and livestock, the classic Welsh "mixed farm" of its day. The occupier at the time was John Norbury and the landowner was the Dean and Chapter of Winchester.`

      content: `Three decades later the first large-scale OS map captures the farm in full Victorian stride. New buildings flank the original farmhouse, while neat lines of trees mark the boundaries. The map labels the holding "Caeau", affirming both its Welsh roots. Produce at this time would have travelled to town markets by horse-drawn cart.`

John passed away aged 39 and the farm passed to his brother, Robert Williams, known locally as "Bob the Caia"`

A Dutch-barn now appear aside the farmhouse, at this time it is likely that electricity lines now cross the fields. Yet the core farmhouse remained unchanged, still anchoring the landscape just as they did a century before.`

Our aim is simple:
to blend modern rural enterprise with the deep-rooted heritage of Caia Farm, preserving its history as a farmwhile diversifying the interests.`
